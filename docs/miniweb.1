.Nd lightweight HTTP server for OpenBSD system monitoring
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hv
.Op Fl b Ar address
.Op Fl c Ar connections
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl t Ar threads
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a lightweight HTTP server designed for OpenBSD system monitoring
and metrics collection.
It provides a web-based dashboard, a RESTful JSON API for system metrics,
and an integrated manual page browser.
.Pp
.Nm
uses a single
.Xr kqueue 2
instance managed by a dedicated dispatcher thread.
When a connection becomes read-ready, the event is delivered once
.Pq using Dv EV_DISPATCH
and the connection is placed on a work queue.
Worker threads dequeue connections, accumulate the full HTTP request,
parse it, dispatch to the appropriate handler, and close the connection.
This design avoids busy-waiting and eliminates race conditions between workers.
.Pp
.Xr pledge 2
and
.Xr unveil 2
are applied at startup to restrict the process to the minimum required
system calls and filesystem paths.
System metrics are gathered via
.Xr sysctl 2
without spawning external processes.
Manual page rendering delegates to
.Xr mandoc 1
via a subprocess with an enforced timeout.
.Pp
.Nm
does not implement TLS directly.
For production deployments, place it behind
.Xr relayd 8
for TLS termination.
See
.Sx EXAMPLES
for a working
.Xr relayd 8
configuration.
.Pp
At startup
.Nm
loads a configuration file if one is found
.Pq see Sx CONFIGURATION FILE .
Command-line flags always override file values.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar address
Bind to the specified IPv4 address.
The default is
.Cm 127.0.0.1
.Pq loopback only .
Use
.Cm 0.0.0.0
to listen on all interfaces.
When deployed behind
.Xr relayd 8 ,
the default loopback binding is recommended.
.It Fl c Ar connections
Set the maximum number of concurrent connections.
The default is
.Cm 1280 .
Connections beyond this limit receive a 503 response and are closed
immediately.
.It Fl f Ar file
Load configuration from
.Ar file
instead of searching the default locations.
If the specified file does not exist or cannot be parsed,
.Nm
exits with an error.
See
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILE
for the file format and default search order.
.It Fl h
Print a usage summary and exit.
.It Fl p Ar port
Listen on the specified TCP port.
The default is
.Cm 9001 .
Ports below 1024 require root privileges.
.It Fl t Ar threads
Set the number of worker threads.
The default is
.Cm 4 .
Each worker independently dequeues and processes connections.
A value matching the CPU core count is a reasonable starting point.
The maximum is
.Cm 4
as compiled; recompile with a higher
.Dv THREAD_POOL_SIZE
to increase it.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose logging to standard error.
Logs include connection accept/close events, worker dispatch, and
security initialisation details.
.El
.Sh FEATURES
.Bl -bullet -compact

.Sh ENDPOINTS
.Nm
provides the following HTTP endpoints.
Responses follow HTTP/1.1 connection semantics: keep-alive is enabled by
default for HTTP/1.1 unless the client sends
.Cm Connection: close .
Handlers may also force close behavior, and each connection is capped at 64
served requests before being closed.
.Ss Web Interface
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /
Main dashboard with system overview.
Tabbed navigation covers load averages, memory, disk, network interfaces,
and process information.
.It Pa /docs
Manual page browser with search powered by
.Xr apropos 1 .
.It Pa /networking
Network interface overview including routes and DNS configuration.
.It Pa /packages
Local package manager interface for searching package names, inspecting package
metadata, and mapping file paths to owning packages.
.It Pa /apiroot
API index page listing available endpoints and their response formats.
.El
.Ss Adding or Removing Regular Pages
Template-backed pages such as
.Pa /
and
.Pa /docs
are defined in a static table in
.Pa src/urls.c
.Pq Dv view_routes .
Each entry maps a method/path pair to:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
page title
.It
main content template
.Pq e.g. Pa dashboard.html
.It
optional extra head partial
.It
optional extra JavaScript partial
.El
.Pp
To add a page (for example
.Pa /about ):
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Create templates in
.Pa templates/
for the main content and optional extras.
.It
Add a new entry to
.Dv view_routes
in
.Pa src/urls.c .
.It
Rebuild; startup route registration will include it automatically.
.El
.Pp
To remove a page, delete its corresponding
.Dv view_routes
entry and rebuild.
Requests to the removed path will then return 404.
.Ss Metrics API
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /api/metrics
Returns a JSON object with the following fields:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
System information: hostname, OS version, uptime, architecture.

.El
.Pp
Metrics are cached to reduce
.Xr sysctl 2
call overhead.
.It Pa /api/networking
Returns a JSON object with network interface details,
routing table entries, and DNS resolver configuration.
.El
.Ss Packages API
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.Xr pkg_info -q .
.El
.Ss Manual Page API
.Bl -tag -width "/api/man/search"
.It Pa /api/man/search
Accepts a
.Cm ?q=
query parameter and returns raw
.Xr apropos 1
output, one entry per line.
Unlike other API endpoints, the response content type is
.Cm text/plain
to simplify line-based parsing in the frontend.
.It Pa /man/ Ns Ar area Ns / Ns Ar section Ns / Ns Ar page Ns Op Ar .ext
Renders a manual page via
.Xr mandoc 1 .
Supported extensions and their output formats:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".html" -compact
.It Cm .html
HTML output
.Pq default if no extension is given .
.It Cm .md
Markdown.
.It Cm .pdf
PDF.
.It Cm .ps
PostScript.
.El
.Pp
Rendered man pages are cached for reuse under
.Pa static/man/ Ns Ar area Ns / Ns Ar section Ns / Ns Ar page Ns . Ns Ar ext
\(em equivalently
.Pa {static_dir}/man/...
using the configured static directory.
.El
.Ss Static Files
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /static/ Ns Ar path
Serves static assets including CSS, JavaScript, and images.
The path component is validated to reject
.Sq ..
and
.Sq //
sequences.
Files are served from the

.El
.Sh ARCHITECTURE
.Ss Request lifecycle
.Bd -literal -offset indent
accept()
   |
   v
kqueue dispatcher (main thread)
   |  EV_DISPATCH -> event auto-disabled after delivery
   v
work queue (pthread_cond_wait, zero busy-waiting)
   |
   v
worker thread (1 of N)
   |  recv() -> parse -> route_match() -> handler()
   v
close(fd) + free_connection()
.Ed
.Pp
The main thread performs accept and queueing only.
Workers do not call
.Xr kevent 2 ,
which avoids worker-side races.
Use of
.Dv EV_DISPATCH
ensures one delivery per readiness event, preventing two workers from
processing the same connection concurrently.
.Ss Key components
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa src/main.c
Single
.Xr kqueue 2
owned by the dispatcher thread, connection pool indexed by file
descriptor, generation counters for stale descriptor detection, and
periodic idle timeout sweeps.
.It Pa src/metrics.c
System metrics through native interfaces only:
.Xr sysctl 2 ,
.Xr getloadavg 3 ,
.Xr getmntinfo 3 ,
.Xr getifaddrs 3 ;
includes a retry loop around
.Dv KERN_PROC_ALL
snapshot sizing.
.It Pa src/http_handler.c
Thread-safe per-request scratch buffers for header extraction and
effective client IP computation with precedence:
X-Real-IP, then X-Forwarded-For (first value), then peer socket address.
.It Pa src/template_engine.c
Minimal
.Cm {{TOKEN}}
substitution-based rendering from files under
.Pa templates/ .
.El
.Sh PERFORMANCE
Measured on OpenBSD 7.8 (amd64, 4-core CPU) with
.Xr wrk 1
.Pq 4 threads, 30 s run :
.Bl -tag -width "/static/test.html (150 conns)"
.It Pa /static/test.txt Pq 100 connections
15,842.60 requests/s;
avg latency 6.25 ms
.Pq p50 6.42 ms, p99 9.30 ms .
.It Pa /static/test.html Pq 150 connections
16,357.15 requests/s;
avg latency 15.91 ms
.Pq p50 7.06 ms, p99 143.26 ms .
.It Pa /apiroot Pq 100 connections
11,094.69 requests/s;
avg latency 9.03 ms
.Pq p50 8.70 ms, p99 13.19 ms .
.El
.Pp
The elevated p99 at 150 connections on
.Pa /static/test.html
reflects connection-limit backpressure
.Pq a portion of requests receives 503 ,
not handler overhead; static throughput remains stable above 16,000 requests/s.

.Ss Additional mitigations
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Static path traversal protection: requests containing
.Sq ..
or
.Sq //
are rejected.
.It
Connection limiter: excess accepted clients are answered with HTTP 503
and immediately closed.
.It
Input sanitisation for manual page parameters before invoking
.Xr mandoc 1 .
.It
Reverse-proxy headers are trusted only from
.Cm trusted_proxy .
.El
.Ss Known limitations
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
No built-in TLS.
.It
No authentication layer.
.It
Some JSON fields can be truncated by fixed-size buffers under extreme
input sizes.
.It
Timeout logic cannot preempt a kernel-level stall inside
.Xr mandoc 1 .
.El
.Sh REVERSE PROXY
.Nm
is designed to run behind
.Xr relayd 8 .
When a reverse proxy is present,
.Nm
reads the following request headers to determine the real client
address and original protocol:
.Bl -tag -width "X-Forwarded-Proto" -compact
.It Cm X-Real-IP
Preferred header for the client IP address.
.It Cm X-Forwarded-For
Used if
.Cm X-Real-IP
is absent; the first comma-separated value is taken.
.It Cm X-Forwarded-Proto
Set to
.Cm https
by
.Xr relayd 8
to indicate that the original connection used TLS.
.El
.Pp
If none of these headers are present, the peer address of the TCP
connection is used.
.Pp
These headers should be set exclusively by the reverse proxy and must
not be accepted from untrusted clients.
Configure
.Xr relayd 8
to overwrite rather than append them.
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
.Nm
reads a configuration file at startup before applying command-line flags.
The file is searched in the following order; the first match is used:
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Path supplied with
.Fl f Ar file
.Pq explicit, failure is fatal .
.It
.Pa ./miniweb.conf
.Pq current working directory .
.It
.Pa $HOME/.miniweb.conf

.Pa /etc/miniweb.conf
.El
.Pp
If no file is found, compiled-in defaults are used.
Command-line flags always take precedence over file values.
.Pp
The file format is one directive per line:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

worker pool, removing the external library dependency and improving
throughput from roughly 7,000 requests per second to over 16,000
requests per second on static-file benchmarks on a four-core system
(approximately +128%, measured with
.Xr wrk 1
at 100\(en150 concurrent connections).
A configuration file facility was added shortly after,
replacing all hardcoded values with a runtime-configurable
.Pa miniweb.conf
read by
.Pa src/conf.c .

.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
is OpenBSD-specific.
It depends on
.Xr kqueue 2 ,
.Xr pledge 2 ,
.Xr unveil 2 ,
and OpenBSD
.Xr sysctl 2
MIBs.
Porting to other systems requires substantial changes.
.Pp
The manual page renderer invokes
.Xr mandoc 1
as a subprocess.
Although isolated by
.Xr pledge 2
and
.Xr unveil 2 ,
the subprocess execution path represents additional attack surface.
User-supplied section, area, and page name components are sanitised
before use; only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores,
periods, and plus signs are permitted.
.Pp
JSON output uses fixed-size buffers.
Extremely long hostnames, mount point paths, or process argument
lists may be silently truncated.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.Nm
implements layered security using native OpenBSD facilities:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Xr pledge 2
restricts available system calls to those required for normal operation.
.It
.Xr unveil 2
limits filesystem access to
.Pa templates/ ,
.Pa static/ ,
the system manual page directories, and a small set of executable paths.
.It
Path traversal is rejected in the static file handler by refusing any
path containing
.Sq ..
or
.Sq //
sequences.
.It
The connection pool limits active connections and allocates each on the
heap; a connection exceeding the pool size receives a 503 response and
is closed without further processing.
.It
.Cm X-Forwarded-For
and related headers are set by
.Xr relayd 8
and must not be trusted from direct external connections.
Deploy with
.Fl b Cm 127.0.0.1
and route all external traffic through the reverse proxy.
.El
.Pp
Never expose
.Nm
directly to untrusted networks.
.Sh BUGS
Subprocess timeout handling for
.Xr mandoc 1
invocations relies on
.Xr poll 2
with a wall-clock deadline.
A kernel stall inside
.Xr mandoc 1
itself cannot be interrupted by this mechanism.
.Pp
The template engine performs token substitution without HTML escaping.
Currently all values passed to templates are trusted strings written
directly in the source code, so no user input reaches the substitution
step and there is no immediate risk.
If future changes introduce user-supplied input into template rendering
.Pq for example, echoing a search query into a page title ,
a proper escaping pass must be added to prevent cross-site scripting.
.Pp
Only IPv4 is supported.
IPv6 requires changes to the socket creation and address handling code.
